**Defining and measuring fracture**: 

- Fracture variability in treatment: 

Methods to measure fracture? 
1. Comparison of variability sums in masked and unmasked rounds: 
   a. Group level 
   b. Individual level 
   	  i. Individual level? 
   	 - Non // parametric test individual viability sums in mask + unmask 
   	 - Tukey post hoc 
   	  ii. Group level? 
     - Non // parametric test room viability sums in mask + unmask

Interesting results: 
- Differences between group and individual significant 
- Both are significant 

- Points on defining fracture: 
- If at an individual level, how many significant individual differences will we consider before defining fracture? 

2. What's interesting? 
e.g. : 1,2,1 
Difference between viability sums in round 1 and 3 
- If same: interesting 
- If different: interesting 
- If random: not interesting 

Round 1 & 3: we care about for fracture purposes 
Round 2: we don't care about for fracture purposes, do care about for a.) scale validation b.) general fracture measurements (e.g. blacklist predictions based on aggregate distribution)

**Using viability scores to predict blacklist proabilities**: 
Examples: 
- If aggregate of viability is below X, likelihood of blacklist is X  
- If aggregate viability score is lower than other team scores by 10%, then interpret as fracture 

Measurement of fracture: answerable without treatment 
Measurement of consistency of fracture: answerable only with treatment 

Predictive models: 
- Caret (R package)
- Blacklist needs to be numeric 

How might we use question 15 in predictive modeling? 
- What does that get us? 
Question 15 is helpful for variability 

Best visualizations: 
- Boxplot and barplot facet grid for paired mean differences
