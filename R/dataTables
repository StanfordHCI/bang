Breakdown of what final R notebook should include: 

## All install.packages + libraries 
    1. GGplot2 
    2. Jsonlite 
    3. Tidyverse 
    4. Likert
    5. Psych 
    6. Datatable 

## Included instructions on what each chunk is cleaning and why (+ add brief description of how to interpret results)

cleanData = 
Criteria: 
1. Complete batches (bonuses!=0? if not confident that complete batches is accurate?)
2. Room  
3. Viability  
4. Psychological safety 
3. New row for each round of survey answers 
4. Factor levels 
	a. Survey 
	b. Repeat team question 
	c. Blacklist 

+ hidden function to filter cleanData based on variables (e.g. list of batch numbers, round, etc. for more case study style apporach to 
data analysis) 

##2 Likert datatables: 

psychSafetyLikert: 

1. Psych safety likert 
	a. Select columns contain psychsafety 
	b. Add labels  
	b. Summary table of answer distributions 
	c. Traditional likert plot 
	d. Heat wave likert plot  

viabilityLikert: 

2. Viability likert 
	a. Select columns contain viability 
	b. Add labels  
	b. Summary table of answer distributions 
	c. Traditional likert plot 
	d. Heat wave likert plot  

##3 

viabilityNumeric: 

1. as.factor: as.numeric 
2. New column: sum of viability questions: viabilitySum
3. New column: mean of viability scores: viabilityMean 
4. New column: standard deviation of viability scores 

**Graphs:** 

viabilityMeanDistribution: (1 graph)

1. GGplot mean distribution + viability sum 

repeatTeamViabilitySum: (3 graphs)

1. GGplot viability sum + repeat team question  
2. GGplot viability sum + repeat team question (overlay round + room) 
3. GGplot viability sum + facet_grid 

***Statistical analyses***: 

1. Use Wilcox test to test for a difference in scoring tendancies between exactly 2 groups 
2. Use Kruskal-Wallis Test to test for a difference in scoring tendancies between 2+ groups
3. To test for a difference in means between two groups: use Anova to treat this type of data if we there is a “normally” distributed continious
4. If parametric inference is justified, run following tests: 
Examples: 

***What questions do we want to answer***: 

1. How are we defining fracture based on reuslts from our runs?
